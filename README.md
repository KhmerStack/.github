# Welcome to KhmerStack 🇰🇭

**Build. Learn. Open Source.**

KhmerStack is an open-source collective based in Cambodia. We build practical software tools for developers while providing a space for **students and juniors** to gain real-world experience.

### 🚀 Our Mission
1.  **Build Real Tools:** We create software that people actually use (like *Quantum Clipboard*).
2.  **Support Juniors:** We bridge the gap between "University Theory" and "Production Code."
3.  **Open to the World:** While we start in Cambodia, our code and community are global.

### 👩‍💻 For Students & Juniors
If you are a student looking to improve your CV/Portfolio:
* **Don't be afraid to break things.** We are here to guide you.
* **Learn strict standards.** We use professional workflows (CI/CD, Code Review, Testing) so you are ready for a real job.
* **Get Mentorship.** Your Pull Requests will receive constructive feedback, not just "yes" or "no."

### 🛠 Active Projects
* **[Quantum Clipboard](link-to-repo):** An advanced, privacy-focused clipboard manager.
* **[API Tools](link-to-repo):** Lightweight API testing utilities.
* *(More coming soon...)*

### 💎 Rewards & Sponsorship
We are a community project, not a corporation. However, we believe in supporting talent.
* **Micro-Rewards:** Occasionally, we offer small financial "thank yous" for difficult bug fixes or great features.
* **Future Goals:** As we grow, we aim to secure sponsorships to fund student contributors more consistently.
